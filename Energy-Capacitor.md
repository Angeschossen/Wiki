## Use

An Energy Capacitor is used for storage of energy throughout an energy system. It mostly is used as a battery backup when you run out of fuel for a generator or the sun goes down while using a Solar Generator. They are also used as wires, to expand your energy network.

They are also used in the crafting of some other machines, i.e. the Fluid Pump
