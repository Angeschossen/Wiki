# Special Bows
Slimefun adds 3 "special" Bows, the Icy Bow, the Explosive Bow and the Soulbound Bow. 
They act like a normal bow as well - you can put enchantments on them - but they also have a special ability.

### Explosive Bow
The Explosive Bow launches the entity it hit up into the air.

### Icy Bow
The Icy Bow gives any entity it hits slowness and a negative Jump Boost for 2 seconds, preventing them from moving.

### Soulbound Bow
The Soulbound Bow is not dropped on death. <br /> _**See:** [Soulbound Weapons](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Soulbound-Weapons)_
