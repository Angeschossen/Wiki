## Use

The Auto Disenchanter is a machine that is used to take off Enchantments via Enchanted Books on Slimefun or Vanilla Items. The amount of enchantments on the item determines the amount of time the item will take to disenchant. Enchantments that do not work on items, (ex. Efficiency on a Sword), will be applied but won't take extra time. The machine will output the un-enchanted item and a enchanted book.
