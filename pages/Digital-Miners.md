# Digital Miners
The Digital Miners are 2 machines that are a gigantic facility when you get started with mining. The two Digital Miner types can been seen below.

### Digital Miner
The Digital Miner's mining range is a 9x9, and it will mine till the bedrock level. The only thing that it can mine are the normal vanilla ores. To activate it, you need to right click the dispener. If any ores are found in that 9x9 area, you will see the breaking particles of the corresponding ore, and after 5 seconds, the broken ore will appear inside the chest above it.

### Advanced Digital Miner
The Advanced Digital Miner's speciality is, that you can get the crushed version of that ore without the need of an Ore Crusher! This can be especially useful if you want to save time by not making an Ore Crusher. Not only that, but it also has a bigger range, 13x13. The only downside of the Advanced Digital Miner is, that instead of Iron Blocks, 24-Carat Gold Blocks are needed, which can be rather expensive for somebody who just started out.
