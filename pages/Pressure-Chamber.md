# Pressure Chamber
The Pressure Chamber can be used to pressurize stuff. To activate it, right click the cauldron under the glass piece. If the recipe you put in it is valid, smoke particles will appear in the middle of the glass, and 3 second after, the result should appear inside the dispenser.

A picture of it's setup can be seen here:
