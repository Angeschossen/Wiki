# Smeltery
The smeltery is one of the most important machines as well. It is used to smelt dusts into ingots and to make alloys.
NOTE: The smeltery requires to have a flame under it to work. While smelting items, the fire might randomly go out, meaning you will have to reignite it.

Example of its setup:

### Suggestions
* Put a piece of netherrack 2 blocks under the smeltery, so the fire instantly stays on.
* Make a redstone clock leading into a dispenser filled with Flint & Steel. This will get rid of the rid of constant need to refire the smeltery, so you can focus on crafting!
