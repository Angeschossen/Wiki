The smeltery is one of the most fundamental Slimefun machines.<br>
It is not only used to smelt dusts into Ingots but also for making Alloys.

**NOTE: The smeltery requires fire beneath it. While smelting items, the fire will randomly get consumed, so make sure to reignite it when that happens.**

## How to build a Smeltery
The recipe is already found in your Slimefun Guide, but here is the final version:

## Tips and tricks
Since the Smeltery's fire can be consumed every so often, make sure to either have a Flint and Steel ready or do one of the following tricks:
* Put a piece of netherrack 2 blocks under the smeltery, so the fire does not randomly go out without actually using it.
* Make a redstone clock leading into a dispenser filled with Flint & Steel. This will get rid of the constant need to refire the smeltery, so you can focus on crafting!
* Utilise an [Automated Ignition Chamber](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Automated-Ignition-Chamber), which will automatically re-ignite the fire.
