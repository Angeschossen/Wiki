## How can I download / install Slimefun or its Addons?
To download and install Slimefun you can refer to [this guide here](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Installing-Slimefun).  
You can find Addons for Slimefun4 on our ["Addons" - page](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Addons).<br>
You can install these just like you did with Slimefun, putting them in the `/plugins/` folder of your Server.

## Can I install Slimefun on a Singleplayer world?
No.<br>
Slimefun is a Bukkit / Spigot plugin, so it requires you to have a Bukkit-based Minecraft Server running. Creating such a Server is very easy though, you will be able to find lots of tutorials online. If you want to enjoy Slimefun all on your own, set up a new Minecraft Server on your computer, install the plugin and connect to it using the address `localhost`. Without any extra efforts your server won't be visible to others outside of your local network anyway.

## I have an error/bug with Slimefun
Ok, first things first, join our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/fsD4Bkh) if you aren't in it already and go to `#bug-discussions`. We need to determine if it is a bug, user error or intended behaviour. Note that we **do not accept bug reports on discord, only on GitHub**. But experience has shown that 9 of 10 "bugs" tend to be the result of really outdated plugin versions or similar, so please try to discuss these issues with others on our discord server first, so that developers can focus on confirmed bug reports.

Now, send us the following information (in the `#bug-discussions` channel):
1. Run /sf versions and send us a screenshot. We need the exact versions you are using, otherwise, we will not be able to help you.
"latest" is not helping us at all. So please run that command. (If you don't have access to this command then Shift-Right-Click your Slimefun Guide, you can find your versions in the uppermost middle slot.)

2. Check your console, are there any errors? (If so, then post them via https://pastebin.com/)

3. What do you intend to happen and what is happening?

Please also refer to [this page](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/How-to-report-bugs) for a much more in-depth guide on how to report issues.

Once you've sent us all this info then one of our staff or a community member will help you. **Do not ping any role or members**. If some time has passed (15+ mins) then you may ping the helpful role (`@Helpful`). Being impatient and pinging roles/members (**especially staff**) may get you warned or kicked.

## What's the difference between the talisman and ender talisman?
The Ender Talismans work even while in the Ender Chest however the normal [Talismans](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Talismans) requires for it to be in your inventory.

## Can you stack Talismans?
Talismans by themselves are stackable items but having more than one Talisman of the same type will not increase their effects.<br>
However, some Talismans get consumed when you use them, so having multiple of these handy will last you longer obviously.

## What can I do with stone chunks?
4 Stone Chunks can be put into the [Compressor](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Compressor) to craft one cobblestone.

## How do I disable items per-world?
You can disable items per-world by finding said world file in the folder `/plugins/Slimefun/world-settings/` and by setting any item ID to false.

If you wish to disable **all** items in the world by setting `enabled` to false.

## How much RAM does Slimefun use?
You can't give an exact number or really even an estimate, we don't know your other plugins, addons, your server software, server version and we may even change things per-build which can affect RAM usage. We can recommend **at least** 4GB for any server though with or __without__ Slimefun.

## How does XYZ work?
