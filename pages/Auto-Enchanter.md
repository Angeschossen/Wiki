## Use

The Auto Enchanter is a machine that is used to apply Enchantments via Enchanted Books onto Slimefun Items. The amount of enchantments on the enchanted books determines the amount of time the item will take to enchant. Enchantments that do not work on items, (ex. Efficiency on a Sword), will be applied but won't take extra time. The machine will output the item and a normal book.
