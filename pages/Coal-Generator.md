## Use

The Coal Generator is an Average Generator. Despite calling the machine a "Coal" Generator, the Coal Generator can use many types of fuels. The fuels that can be used also can be used in a vanilla furnace. Since Wooden Planks and Logs generate the same amount of power, it is recommended that you break logs into planks. Using a [Sawmill](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Saw-Mill) will increase the amount of power generated per log.
