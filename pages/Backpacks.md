# Backpacks
Backpacks are a collection of utilities in which you can store items. 
When you initially open a Backpack, it gets assigned a UUID. 
The UUID's format is basically this: 

(Player's UUID)#(Number of Player's backpack)

 The Backpack's restrictions are that you cannot name them, and put backpacks into other backpacks, as that would be overpowered.

**NOTE: When you open a backpack, you can NOT upgrade it anymore.**
