The Gold Pan is a very important Item in Slimefun.<br>
There are two variants, the normal Gold Pan and the [Nether Gold Pan](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Nether-Gold-Pan).<br>
This page will only cover the standard Gold Pan.

## How to use the Gold Pan
You right-click a block of gravel while holding a Gold Pan in your main hand.<br>
The block will break and drop Flint, clay or [Sifted Ore](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Sifted-Ore).

You can read more about [Sifted Ore](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Sifted-Ore) and how to use it in Slimefun's ["Getting Started" Guide](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Getting-Started)

## Automating your Gold Pan
If you ever get tired of right-clicking gravel, then check out the [Automated Panning Machine](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Automated-Panning-Machine).
