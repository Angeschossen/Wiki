The Gold Pan is a very important Item that is part of the [Items - Category](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Items).

## How to use the Gold Pan
You right-click a block of gravel while holding a Gold Pan in your main hand.<br>
The block will break and drop Flint, clay or [Sifted Ore](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Sifted-Ore).

You can read more about [Sifted Ore](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Sifted-Ore) and how to use it in Slimefun's ["Getting Started" Guide](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Getting-Started)
