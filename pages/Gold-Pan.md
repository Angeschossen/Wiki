# Gold Pan
The Gold Pan is the simplest way of getting Sifted Ore, an item which can be used in an [Ore Washer](https://github.com/mrCookieSlime/Slimefun4/wiki/Ore-Washer) to get different types of dusts. To use it, right click it on a piece of gravel. The gravel block will disappear, and a piece of Flint, Clay, or Sifted Ore will drop on it's location.

### Suggestions
A very good way of finding gravel is by going in an ocean, while being equipped with a Scuba Helmet and a pair of boots enchanted with Depth Strider.
