## Why should I use Slimefun?
You don't have to use Slimefun.
But it has proven itself to be a fun-addition to a lot of servers.
It enhances any Survival Experience, no matter the gamemode.

## Will there be constant updates?
Yes and no.

You will find very frequent (automatically uploaded) updates on [TheBusyBiscuit's Website](https://thebusybiscuit.github.io/builds/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/master/).
These are most often just bug fixes and minor tweaks.
Keep in mind that Slimefun4 is maintained by the community, not a single person or group of people.
So these updates can be very irregular.

But if you are looking for even more Slimefun-content, then you should check out some of [Slimefun's Addons](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Addons).
You can of course add your own content to Slimefun and make a Pull Request, it has to be reviewed and approved though.
It is much faster and also recommended to develop an Addon instead.

## Slimefun's Story
It is a Plugin that was developed by mrCookieSlime in 2013, the goal was simple: Making Bukkit Servers feel like modpacks.
Over the years Slimefun continued to grow.
At the end of 2013 Slimefun2 was released, it featured Researches, a proper Slimefun Guide, Armor, Weapons and many more Items that help you survive.

One year later, in 2014, Slimefun3 came about.
Slimefun3 had a more technical-centered theme, adding Miners, electrical Machines, Backpacks and much more.
Many Servers jumped onto the hype, adapting this plugin for their Survival, Towny, Factions or even Skyblock Servers.
Slimefun3 was around for a long time.

In mid-2015, mrCookieSlime opened his own Minecraft Server: "Cookie's Realm".
At the end of the year, Slimefun4 was available for Beta-Testing, exclusive for Cookie's Realm at first.
Slimefun4 added tons of new elements: Item transport, Energy Networks, Nuclear Reactors, GPS, little Androids that can mine.
There is too much too list.
Slimefun4 was released to the public in April of 2016 and it was also made open-source.

In late 2016 mrCookieSlime announced his retirement.
He now goes by the name of TheBusyBiscuit and pursued his interests in game development.
Slimefun4 is still available for download and well-maintained by the public community that has been built around the plugin over years.
TheBusyBiscuit still reviews code proposed by community-contributors and does a little maintenance on the plugin here and there.
