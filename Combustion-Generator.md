## Use

The Combustion Generator is an Advanced generator. It uses [Oil](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Oil) as fuel. [Oil](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Oil) can be placed in a [Refinery](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Refinery) to be turned into [Fuel](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Oil), which burns for longer in the Combustion Generator, generating more fuel. The bucket will be returned once the fuel is completely used.

## Energy Usage

Combustion Generator has a 256 J Buffer
