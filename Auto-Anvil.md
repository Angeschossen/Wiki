## Use

The Auto Anvil is a machine that can be used to repair normal Minecraft Tools, Weapons, Armor, etc...
but it can also be used to repair Slimefun [Armor](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Armor) and [Tools](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Tools). Slimefun items cannot be used inside a normal anvil, and require an Auto Anvil to be repaired. The Auto Anvil has two inputs, one for the item you wish to repair and one for Duct Tape.
