The Cargo Manager is the core machine that powers the rest of a [Cargo Management System](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Cargo-Management-System). Its signal has a five block range in any direction (not diagonally). If a [Cargo Node (Connector)](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Cargo-Nodes#connector-node) is placed within that range, the signal will be extended an additional five blocks from the **Connector Node**'s location. When right clicked, the Cargo Manager will toggle visibility of the Cargo Net Visualizer, or the system's signals and connections.
