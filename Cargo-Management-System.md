A Cargo Management System is comprised of [Cargo Nodes](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Cargo-Nodes) and a [Cargo Manager](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Cargo-Manager) that use different channels and connections to transfer items from one container to another without many distance limitations. Items will exit an input container and be transferred through 1 of 16 [Channels](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Cargo-Management-System#channels) (one for each color of wool).

## Cargo Management Channels
Cargo Management Channels are used to separate the routes that items take in each **Cargo System**. They are numbered 1-16 and labelled with all 16 colors of the wool, meaning a **Cargo System** is only limited to 16 channels. These channels can be edited by right clicking an [Input Node](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Cargo-Nodes#input-node) or an [Advanced Output Node](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Cargo-Nodes#advanced) and navigating through them. The **Input** and **Output Nodes** both must be the set at the same channel to properly transport items.
