## Use

The Electric Furnace is a replacement for the vanilla furnace, but it uses electricity instead of fuel. It smelts vanilla ores, but it will not turn Slimefun [Dusts](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Dusts) into [Ingots or Alloys](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Ingots).
