## Use

The Solar Generator is an easy generator for getting power since it requires no fuel and inexpensive cost. While it easily generates power, it has the downside of not generating any power during the night (exception of the Energized version), so you are unable to use most machines for a long time during night. [Energy Capacitors](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Energy-Capacitor/) are recommended so you can use machines during the night.
