_"Core Component of an Energy Network"_

***
## Use

An Energy Regulator is necessary for any transfer of energy between machines, generators, and stored energy, and it will tell you the collective amount of energy is inside all of the machines, generators, and capacitors that are inside the Regulator's range of effect. They can transfer energy through machines up to 7 blocks through straight lines (no diagonals) before the signal runs out.
You can expand this Range via [Energy Capacitors](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/wiki/Energy-Capacitor)
